# Full-screen mode theme
A theme that literally makes **the entire album art fills up the entire screen on Full-screen mode** _(by height)_

## Features
- Cool-looking album art which gets transparent on the very edge
- Track info moved to the top left
- Video mode will keep its appearances that way, but the video (track) info would still be put on top of the frame
- Uses RICS, which makes the code very organizable (truly) for if one were to change theme code
