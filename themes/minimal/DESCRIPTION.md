# Better Lyrics – Minimal Immersive Theme (v1.6.8)

A clean, performance-focused theme for the **Better Lyrics** extension on **YouTube Music**.

Optimized to use minimal resources for portrait view. & many quality of life changes.

This theme removes most lyric swipe/word animations and replaces them with a smooth, opacity-based focus system. The result is a calm, immersive, distraction-free lyrics experience with dynamic blurred album art backgrounds.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

- **Minimal motion**
- **Strong focus on current lyric**
- **Soft, immersive blurred background**
- **Consistent typography**
- **Performance-aware design**

Animations are intentionally disabled or simplified for a stable and readable experience.

---

## 🔤 Typography

- Uses **Roboto Flex** via Google Fonts.
- Applies globally across the page (can be removed in Section 2 if you prefer YouTube defaults).
- Heavy emphasis on:
  - High contrast white text
  - Clean scaling
  - Balanced line height

To revert to default YouTube font:
- Delete the `font-family` override in **Section-2**.

## 🎯 Lyrics Behavior

### Visibility Model (Section 3.1)

The theme uses opacity instead of animation emphasis:

| Lyric State | Default Opacity |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Current     | `1` (100%)      |
| Previous    | `0.35`          |
| Next        | `0.02`          |

You can adjust:

```css
--current-lyric-visibility
--previous-lyrics-visibility
--next-lyrics-visibility
````

This makes it very easy to:

* Increase focus intensity
* Fade surrounding lines more
* Create a “floating spotlight” effect
* Prevent accidental reading of next lyrics

---

## 🚫 Animation Changes

This theme explicitly:

* Disables rich sync animations
* Removes word glow/wobble effects
* Removes swipe transitions
* Removes shimmer on active words
* Neutralizes pseudo-elements

If you want default Better Lyrics animations back:

Delete:

* **Section-2 font family line**
* **Section 3.1**
* **Section 3.2**
* **Section 4**
* **Section 6**

Then control animations via Better Lyrics settings instead.

---

## 🌌 Background System (Section 3.3)

Dynamic album art background with:

* Blur: `30px`
* Brightness: `0.35`
* Contrast: `0.90`
* Saturation: configurable
* Smooth transition delay

Performance Tip:
Lower this value for better performance:

```css
--blyrics-background-blur
```

You can also:

* Disable background entirely in extension settings
* Adjust brightness for darker or lighter moods

---

## 📱 Fullscreen & Portrait Support

This theme includes:

* Dedicated fullscreen lyric scaling
* Portrait window layout fixes
* Artist page dynamic backgrounds
* Smooth transition between player states
* No-lyrics slide animation
* Sidebar entry smoothing

Portrait mode:

* Removes backdrop filters
* Removes layered gradients
* Ensures clarity and clean edges

---

## 🎵 No Lyrics Experience

If synced lyrics aren’t found:

* Text fades out
* A subtle `♫` symbol appears
* Hover reveals: `"No lyrics found"`

No harsh error screens. Just a calm fallback.

---

## 📦 Loader & Ad Overlay

Custom loader system:

* Opacity animation instead of complex shimmer
* Smooth entry/exit
* No logo spinning

---

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

Includes refined styling for:

* Player queue
* 3-dot menu popup
* Search box background
* Queue drag states
* Toast notifications (auto-dismiss)
* Player bar transparency
* Tab headings (underline highlight system)
* Volume popup rounding
* Album immersive backgrounds

All adjusted to match the immersive dark aesthetic.

---

## ⚙ Performance Notes

For best performance:

1. Lower blur value.
2. Disable background effects in Better Lyrics settings.
3. Keep animations disabled (as designed).

This theme is built to be visually rich without relying on heavy animation logic.
